Besides, using it in the treatment of depression, it is found to be effective in reducing withdrawal symptoms due to smoking cessation. A 28-year-old female patient with a history of depression was admitted to emergency department an hour after ingestion of bupropion, quetiapine, and levothyroxine in high doses to commit suicide. While accepting her into the Intensive Care Unit, she was awake, alert, disoriented and agitated. After 2h, the patient had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. The necessary treatment was given and 9h later with hemodynamic improvement, the patients' mental status improved. Bupropion may cause unusual behaviors such as delusions, paranoia, hallucinations, or confusion. The risk of seizure is strongly dose-dependent. We want to emphasize the importance of early gastric lavage and administration of activated charcoal.\n",

            "The purpose of this work was to develop self-nanomulsifying drug delivery systems (SNEDDS) in sustained-release pellets of ziprasidone to enhance the oral bioavailability and overcome the food effect of ziprasidone. Preformulation studies including screening of excipients for solubility and pseudo-ternary phase diagrams suggested the suitability of Capmul MCM as oil phase, Labrasol as surfactant, and PEG 400 as co-surfactant for preparation of self-nanoemulsifying formulations. Preliminary composition of the SNEDDS formulations were selected from the pseudo-ternary phase diagrams. The prepared ziprasidone-SNEDDS formulations were characterized for self-emulsification time, effect of pH and robustness to dilution, droplet size analysis and zeta potential. The optimized ziprasidone-SNEDDS were used to prepare ziprasidone-SNEDDS sustained-release pellets via extrusion-spheronization method. The pellets were characterized for SEM, particle size, droplet size distribution and zeta potential. In vitro drug release studies indicated the ziprsidone-SNEDDS sustained-release pellets showed sustained release profiles with 90% released within 10 h. The ziprsidone-SNEDDS sustained-release pellets were administered to fasted and fed beagle dogs and their pharmacokinetics were compared to commercial formulation of Zeldox as a control. Pharmacokinetic studies in beagle dogs showed ziprasidone with prolonged actions and enhanced bioavailability with no food effect was achieved simultaneously in ziprsidone-SNEDDS sustained-release pellets compared with Zeldox in fed state. The results indicated a sustained release with prolonged actions of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder treatment.\n",

            "Paliperidone palmitate (PP) is a once-monthly long-acting injectable antipsychotic approved for the treatment of schizophrenia in many countries. To evaluate the different injection-site options, we compared the pharmacokinetic profile of paliperidone after multiple injections of PP 100 mg eq. (156 mg of PP, equivalent to 100 mg of paliperidone) on days 1, 8, 36, and 64 into the deltoid (n = 24) or gluteal muscle (n = 25) in patients with schizophrenia. After four injections in the deltoid muscle, paliperidone exposure was higher for AUCτ and Cmax , compared with the gluteal muscle (geometric mean AUCτ -based ratio: 120% [90% CI: 93.1-154.7%], and geometric mean Cmax -based ratio: 130% [90% CI: 100.6-168.9%]). The mean [SD] fluctuation index was higher, with a larger interpatient variability, after deltoid-injections (75.9% [30.9%]) than gluteal-injections (58.5% [14.3%]). The median tmax was similar for both sites. PP was generally tolerable in patients, with more favorable local-site tolerability for gluteal-injection. In conclusion, to achieve therapeutic-concentrations quickly, the first-two injections of PP are best administered into the deltoid muscle, whereas thereafter maintenance-injections can be administered either in the deltoid or gluteal muscle.\n",

            "The aim of the present study was to objectively identify and measure the psycho-motor disturbances in UD using differentiation between activity and reactivity.\n",
            "An equilibriometric movement pattern analysis system that allows differentiation between psychomotor activity and reactivity was applied in 58 unipolar depressive patients and 76 healthy controls.\n",
            "Compared to controls, the patients as a group were significantly slower in their psychomotor reactivity. However, the subsequent subgrouping according to the direction of deviation of their objective psychomotor parameters revealed a disinhibition of psychomotor activity and/or reactivity in about one half of them. Such a contradictory combination of clinically manifested depressive mood and subclinically detected manic-like psychomotor overactivation might be regarded as belonging to the bipolar spectrum, since it was admitted that manic psychomotor disinhibition in unipolar depressive patients uncovers a latent bipolarity.\n",
            "Not only prototypical depressive inhibition, but also prototypical manic-like disinhibition may underlie clinically manifested UD. Since the combination between depressive mood and psychomotor overactivation multiplies the suicidal risk, we may presume that the timely detection of this combination at a subclinical level would contribute to an earlier and more effective suicidal prevention by an objectively-guided optimization of pharmacological treatment.\n",

With an average national deficit of 77% for psychiatrists in India, there is a need to mobilise more resources to deal with depressive disorders. Therefore, it is pertinent that the physicians are sensitised and trained for recognition and treatment of depressive disorders. Patients with mild to moderate depression, non-psychotic or somatised depression can be managed in primary care settings by general physicians. Unless specifically screened, depression may remain under-recognised and untreated in primary care/medical settings.

            "OBJECTIVE To analyze the trends and factors associated with the antidepressant use among older adults. METHODS This population-based study evaluated older adults in 1997 (n = 351, baseline) and the survivors at the 15th follow-up year (n = 462, in 2012) among the aging cohort of Bambuí. The prevalence of antidepressant use was estimated, and the most commonly used antidepressants each year were identified. Prevalence ratios with 95% confidence intervals were estimated using Poisson regression with robust variance to investigate differences in the prevalence of use between 1997 and 2012. RESULTS The overall consumption of antidepressants (PR = 2.87, 95%CI 1.94;4.25) and of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (PR = 7.50, 95%CI 3.74;15.02) was significantly higher in 2012. However, no significant difference was observed in the use of tricyclic antidepressants between the two cohorts (PR = 0.89, 95%CI 0.49;1.62). In the 2012 cohort, antidepressant use was associated with females, increased age, increased income (≥ 4 minimum wages), self-assessment of health as reasonable, and attending ≥ 5 medical consultations in the last 12 months. CONCLUSIONS The increased consumption of antidepressants in the period due to increased use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors was consistent with results observed in international studies of different population groups and contexts. The positive correlation observed between antidepressant use and family income may be a warning of possible inequalities in access to mental health services.\n",

            "The incidence of aggressive behaviors is higher among persons with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs) than among persons without such disorders. This phenomenon represents a risk to the well-being of patients, their families, and society. The authors undertook a systematic review of the English language literature to determine the efficacy of neuropharmacological agents for the management of hostility and aggression among persons with SSDs. The search combined findings from the Medline, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases. Ninety-two full text articles were identified that reported relevant findings. The American Academy of Neurology criteria were used to determine levels of evidence. Paliperidone-extended release is probably effective for the management of hostility among inpatients with SSDs who have not been preselected for aggression (Level B). Clozapine is possibly more effective than haloperidol for the management of overt aggression and possibly more effective than chlorpromazine for the management of hostility among inpatients with SSDs who have not been preselected for aggression (Level C). Clozapine is also possibly more effective than olanzapine or haloperidol for reducing aggression among selected physically assaultive inpatients (Level C). Adjunctive propranolol, valproic acid, and famotidine are possibly effective for reducing some aspects of hostility or aggression among inpatients with SSDs (Level C). Paliperidone-extended release currently appears to be the agent for the management of hostility among inpatients with SSDs for which there is the strongest evidence of efficacy.\n",

            "Schizophrenia is a highly disabling chronic psychiatric illness. The existing antipsychotic agents are associated with untoward effects and drug interactions leading to the intensification of search for newer agents with better efficacy and safety profile. Securinega virosa is a commonly used medicinal plant in African traditional medicine. The decoction of the leaves of the plant in combination with other plants is used in the management of mental illness. In this study, we evaluate the antipsychotic potential of the methanol leaf extract (25, 50 and 100 mg kg(-1)) of the plant using apomorphine-induced stereotypic climbing behavior and swim-induced grooming tests, all in mice. The CNS depressant effect was also evaluated using ketamine-induced sleep test mice. The extract at the highest dose tested (100 mg kg(-1)) significantly reduced the apomorphine (1 mg kg(-1))-induced stereotypic climbing behavior after 30 min. Similarly, haloperidol (2 mg kg(-1)), the standard agent significantly (p<0.001) decreased the mean climbing behavior. In the swim-induced grooming test, the extract significantly (p<0.01) and dose-dependently decreased the total grooming time. Similarly, haloperidol (2 mg kg(-1)) significantly (p<0.001) decreased the mean grooming activity. The extract significantly increased the total ketamine-induced sleep duration at doses of 50 and 100 mg kg(-1). These findings suggest that the extract possesses antipsychotic and sedative potentials and lend credence to the ethnomedical use of the leaves of the plant in the management of mental illness.\n",

Four hours later animals were tested in the elevated plus-maze. In vehicle-treated animals we detected the increase of anxiety and emotionality level and the decrease of locomotor and investigative activity. In contrast there was no increase of anxiety and emotionality in TRH-treated rats. As to the locomotor and investigative activity, it decreased in TRH-treated animals as well as inthe vehicle-treated.

Differences in behavioral ability between the depression model group and the venlafaxine treatment group were observed in behavioral, sucrose-water and open field tests. The rat hippocampal tissue was sliced, stained and observed for BDNF distribution by immunohistochemistry. Apoptosis of hippocampal neurons was detected by TUNEL. BDNF expression in the hippocampal tissue was detected by Western blot. Injury and apoptosis of the hippocampal tissue were observed by electron microscopy. Behavioral test showed that venlafaxine effectively improved the behavioral abilities of depressed rats. Immunohistochemistry showed that venlafaxine markedly increased BDNF expression in the rat hippocampus. TUNEL showed that venlafaxine markedly inhibited apoptosis of hippocampal neurons, which was also confirmed by electron microscopic observation of the pathologic sections. Venlafaxine improved the expression of BDNF by influencing the PI3k/PKB/eNOS pathway and repressed the apoptosis of hippocampal neurons.\n",

            "The present study aims to perform the comparative assessment of stimulation and blockade for D2-dopaminergic receptors in depression-like behavior in male rats with deficiency of androgen hormones. Two weeks after surgery, GDX rats began 14 days of treatment with vehicle, a low dose of testosterone propionate (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.), quinpirole (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.), sulpiride (10.0 mg/kg, i.p.), quinpirole plus testosterone propionate or sulpiride plus testosterone propionate. The animals were then tested in forced swimming test (FST) and the open field test (OFT). Quinpirole administered alone or in a combination with a low dose of testosterone propionate resulted in antidepressant-like effect in GDX rats in the FST. Repeated treatment of quinpirole and testosterone propionate profoundly increased antidepressant-like effect of the single substances they exert per se. Application of neither quinpirole nor quinpirole plus testosterone propionate led to any changes of behavioral reactions in GDX rats in the OFT, except increased grooming behavior. On the contrary, sulpiride treatment failed to alter depression-like behavior in GDX rats in the FST. In addition, sulpiride blocked the antidepressant-like effect of testosterone propionate in GDX rats and its combination with a low dose of testosterone propionate induced prodepressant-like effect in GDX rats. Co-administration of sulpiride with testosterone propionate or its single application increased frequency of rearing and grooming in GDX rats in the OFT. In summary, the results of the present study suggest that stimulation of D2-dopaminergic receptors results in antidepressant-like effect at androgen deficiency in male rats, while blockade of D2-dopaminergic receptors resulted in prodepressant-like effect.\n",

Compared to depressive episodes, manic recurrences are often brief and usually respond to anti-manic medications within a few weeks. Infrequently bipolar patients get badly affected by protracted manic symptoms that exhibit resistance to the usual anti-manic agents. As mania is a very disruptive condition with severe and adverse consequences for the patient, every effort should be made to bring it under control as soon as possible.

            "As part of a larger project designed to inform prevention and treatment of postpartum depression and promote positive mother-child relationships in diverse families, this study describes personal stories of postnatal adjustment from 14 White and 9 Hispanic women recruited from prenatal care clinics. Qualitative interviews conducted in the mothers' primary language (English or Spanish) were analyzed using a modified grounded theory content-analysis approach. The coding scheme developed to capture the women's discourse about their experiences included child temperament and health; intergenerational patterns; work demands and job loss; schedule changes; increased responsibilities; difficulties with parenting tasks; emotional distress; social stressors and resources; coping strategies; and changes in work, personal, social, and marital domains. More White mothers than Hispanic mothers reported changes in time structure, work stressors, use of psychotropic medication, informational support, and social support from other mothers and professionals; however, within-group differences were more evident than were cross-group ethnic differences. Analyses of qualitative interviews led to the integration of Belsky's Determinants of Parenting Model (1984) and the Double ABCX Model of Family Adjustment and Adaptation (McCubbin & Patterson, 1983) into a hybrid third theoretical framework.\n",

            "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune mediated disorder that is under intensive investigation in an attempt to improve on available treatments. Many of the changes occurring in MS, including increased mitochondrial dysfunction, pain reporting and depression may be partly mediated by increased indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, which drives tryptophan to the production of neuroregulatory tryptophan catabolites and away from serotonin, N-acetylserotonin and melatonin production. The consequences of decreased melatonin have classically been attributed to circadian changes following its release from the pineal gland. However, recent data shows that melatonin may be produced by all mitochondria containing cells to some degree, including astrocytes and immune cells, thereby providing another important MS treatment target. As well as being a powerful antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive, melatonin improves mitochondrial functioning, partly via increased oxidative phosphorylation. Melatonin also inhibits demyelination and increases remyelination, suggesting that its local regulation in white matter astrocytes by serotonin availability and apolipoprotein E4, among other potential factors, will be important in the etiology, course and treatment of MS. Here we review the role of local melatonin and its precursors, N-acetylserotonin and serotonin, in MS.\n",

            "A 37-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with acute phenobarbital poisoning. On arrival, he was in deep coma with respiro-circulatory depressions. The serum concentration of the agent was elevated to 149.04 μg/mL which was consistent with a lethal concentration level. He underwent a gastric lavage, administration of activated charcoal, urinary alkalinazation and bowel irrigation. Respiro-circulatory status was recovered rapidly, while the serum concentration of phenobarbital did not decrease smoothly. Although the concentration of the agent decreased to 77.07 μg/mL that should be a comatose level, BIS values were gradually elevated, and then eventually the patient regained his consciousness. Because he was a chronic user of Vegetamin-A containing phenobarbital, the serum level might not have been correlated with symptoms. BIS values were highly reflective of the consciousness level, so it could be a useful indicator for predicting the consciousness levels of patients in deep coma with acute poisoning from hypnotic agents.\n",

            "Antipsychotic medications are the gold-standard treatment for schizophrenia, and are often prescribed for other mental conditions. However, the efficacy and side-effect profiles of these drugs are heterogeneous, with large interindividual variability. As a result, treatment selection remains a largely trial-and-error process, with many failed treatment regimens endured before finding a tolerable balance between symptom management and side effects. Much of the interindividual variability in response and side effects is due to genetic factors (heritability, h(2)~ 0.60-0.80). Pharmacogenetics is an emerging field that holds the potential to facilitate the selection of the best medication for a particular patient, based on his or her genetic information. In this review we discuss the most promising genetic markers of antipsychotic treatment outcomes, and present current translational research efforts that aim to bring these pharmacogenetic findings to the clinic in the near future.\n",

            "In both clinical trials and daily practice, there can be substantial inter- and even intraindividual variability in response--whether beneficial or adverse--to antidepressants and antipsychotic medications. So far, no tools have become available to predict the outcome of these treatments in specific patients. This is because the causes of such variability are often not known, and when they are, there is no way of predicting the effects of their various potential combinations in an individual. Given this background, this paper presents a conceptual framework for understanding known factors and their combinations so that eventually clinicians can better predict what medication(s) to select and at what dose they can optimize the outcome for a given individual. This framework is flexible enough to be readily adaptable as new information becomes available. The causes of variation in patient response are grouped into four categories: (i) genetics; (ii) age; (iii) disease; and (iv) environment (internal). Four cases of increasing complexity are used to illustrate the applicability of this framework in a clinically relevant way In addition, this paper reviews tools that the clinician can use to assess for and quantify such inter- and intraindividual variability. With the information gained, treatment can be adjusted to compensate for such variability, in order to optimize outcome. Finally, the limitations of existing antidepressant and antipsychotic therapy and the way they reduce current ability to predict response is discussed.\n",

Esto es porque las causas de tal variabilidad a menudo son desconotidas, y cuando se conocen, no hay forma de predecir los efectos de sus varias combinaclones posibles para un sujeto. Teniendo en cuenta estos antecedentes, esta revisión presenta un marco conceptual para la comprensión de los factores conocidos y sus combinaciones para que los clínicos, eventualmente, puedan predecir mejor qué fármaco(s) selectionar y en qué dosis, para optimizar el resultado para un sujeto determinado.

            "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a heterogeneous condition with a variable response to a wide range of treatments. Despite intensive efforts, no biomarker has been identified to date that can reliably predict response or non-response to any form of treatment, nor has one been identified that can be used to identify those at high risk of developing treatment-resistant depression (ie, non-response to a sequence of treatments delivered for adequate duration and intensity). This manuscript reviews some past areas of research that have proved informative, such as studies using indexes of hypercortisolism or sleep disturbance, and more recent research findings using measures of inflammation and different indicators of regional cortical activation to predict treatment response. It is concluded that, although no method has yet been demonstrated to be sufficiently accurate to be applied in clinical practice, progress has been made. It thus seems likely that--at some point in the not-too-distant future--it will be possible to prospectively identify, at least for some MDD patients, the likelihood of response or non-response to cognitive therapy or various antidepressant medications.\n",

Este artículo revisa algunas investigaciones antiguas que aportaron información, como los estudios que emplearon indicadores de hipercortisolismo o alteraciones del sueño, y hallazgos de investigaciones más recientes que han empleado marcadores de la inflamación y diferentes indicadores de activación cortical regional para predecir la respuesta terapéutica. Se concluye que, aunque se han realizado progresos, aun no se ha demostrado que algún método sea totalmente preciso para ser aplicado en la práctica clínica.

            "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a pleomorphic illness originating from gene x environment interactions. Patients with differing symptom phenotypes receive the same diagnosis and similar treatment recommendations without regard to genomics, brain structure or function, or other physiologic or psychosocial factors. Using this present approach, only one third of patients enter remission with the first medication prescribed, and patients may take longer than 1 year to enter remission with repeated trials. Research to improve treatment effectiveness recently has focused on identification of intermediate phenotypes (IPs) that could parse the heterogeneous population of patients with MDD into subgroups with more homogeneous responses to treatment. Such IPs could be used to develop biomarkers that could be applied clinically to match patients with the treatment that would be most likely to lead to remission. Putative biomarkers include genetic polymorphisms, RNA and protein expression (transcriptome and proteome), neurotransmitter levels (metabolome), additional measures of signaling cascades, oscillatory synchrony, neuronal circuits and neural pathways (connectome), along with other possible physiologic measures. All of these measures represent components of a continuum that extends from proximity to the genome to proximity to the clinical phenotype of depression, and there are many levels along this continuum at which useful IPs may be defined. Because of the highly integrative nature of brain systems and the complex neurobiology of depression, the most useful biomarkers are likely to be those with intermediate proximity both to the genome and the clinical phenotype of MDD. Translation of findings across the spectrum from genotype to phenotype promises to better characterize the complex disruptions in signaling and neuroplasticity that accompany MDD, and ultimately to lead to greater understanding of the causes of depressive illness.\n",
            "El trastorno depresivo mayor (TDM) es una enfermedad de variadas formas que surge a partir de las interacciones entre genes y ambiente (GxA). Los pacientes con fenotipos de diferentes síntomas reciben el mismo diagnóstico y similares recomendaciones terapéuticas sin tener en consideración la genómica, la estructura o función cerebral, u otros factores fisiológicos o psicosociales. De acuerdo con esta aproximación solo un tercio de los pacientes alcanza la remisión con la primera medicación prescrita, y los pacientes pueden tardar más de un año en alcanzar la remisión con diversos ensayos. Recientemente la investigación para mejorar la eficacia terapéutica se ha enfocado en la identificación de fenotipos intermedios (FIs) que podrían ser útiles para analizar la heterogénea población de pacientes con TDM en subgrupos con respuestas más homogéneas al tratamiento. Estos FIs podrían emplearse para desarrollar biomarcadores con aplicación en la clínica para indicar el tratamiento que tenga más probabilidades de alcanzar la remisión. Estos llamados marcadores incluyen polimorfismos genéticos, expresión de ARN y proteínas (transcriptoma y proteoma), niveles de neurotransmisores (metaboloma), mediciones adicionales de cascadas de señales, sincronía oscilatoria, circuitos neuronales y vías neurales (conectoma) junto con otras posibles mediciones fisiológicas. Todas estas mediciones representan componentes de un continuo que va desde la proximidad al genoma hasta la proximidad al fenotipo clínico de la depresión y hay muchos niveles a lo largo de este continuo en los cuales se pueden definir FIs útiles. Dada la naturaleza altamente integradora de los sistemas cerebrales y la compleja neurobiología de la depresión, los biomarcadores mas útiles son probablemente aquellos que tienen una proximidad intermedia tanto con el genoma como con el fenotipo clínico del TDM. La traslación de los hallazgos a través del espectro desde el genotipo al fenotipo promete caracterizar mejor las complejas disrupciones en las señales y en la neuroplasticidad que acompañan al TDM y finalmente conducir a una mayor comprensión de las causas de la enfermedad depresiva.\n",

Suivant cette stratégie, seulement un tiers des patients entrent en rémission avec le premier médicament prescrit et, après des traitements multiples, cette rémission met plus d'1 an à survenir. Afin d'améliorer l'efficacité thérapeutique, les chercheurs se sont récemment intéressés à l'identification des phénotypes intermédiaires (PI) permettant d'analyser la population hétérogène des patients atteints de TDM en sous-groupes plus homogènes en termes de réponse au traitement. De tels PI pourraient être utilisés dans le développement de biomarqueurs afin d'apparier les patients au traitement le plus à même d'induire une rémission. Les polymorphismes génétiques, l'expression des protéines et de l'ARN (transcriptome et protéome), les taux de neurotransmetteurs (métabolome), les mesures supplémentaires des cascades de signalisation, la synchronie oscillatoire, les circuits neuronaux et les voies neurales (connectome) font partie des biomarqueurs potentiels tout comme d'autres mesures physiologiques potentielles. Ces mesures appartiennent à un continuum qui s'étend du génome au phénotype clinique du TDM et des PI utiles peuvent être identifiés à de nombreux niveaux tout au long de ce continuum. En raison de la nature hautement interactive des systèmes cérébraux et en raison de la neurobiologie complexe de la dépression, les biomarqueurs les plus utiles sont probablement ceux dont la position est intermédiaire entre le génome et le phénotype clinique du TDM. L'application de découvertes allant du génotype au phénotype permettra de mieux caractériser les anomalies complexes de la signalisation et de la neuroplasticité observées dans le TDM et de mieux comprendre les causes de la dépression.\n",

            "The search for clinical outcome predictors for schizophrenia is as old as the field of psychiatry. However, despite a wealth of large, longitudinal studies into prognostic factors, only very few clinically useful outcome predictors have been identified. The goal of future treatment is to either affect modifiable risk factors, or use nonmodifiable factors to parse patients into therapeutically meaningful subgroups. Most clinical outcome predictors are nonspecific and/or nonmodifiable. Nonmodifiable predictors for poor odds of remission include male sex, younger age at disease onset, poor premorbid adjustment, and severe baseline psychopathology. Modifiable risk factors for poor therapeutic outcomes that clinicians can act upon include longer duration of untreated illness, nonadherence to antipsychotics, comorbidities (especially substance-use disorders), lack of early antipsychotic response, and lack of improvement with non-clozapine antipsychotics, predicting clozapine response. It is hoped that this limited capacity for prediction will improve as pathophysiological understanding increases and/or new treatments for specific aspects of schizophrenia become available.\n",

            "Studies that have used structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggest that individuals with psychoses have brain alterations, particularly in frontal and temporal cortices, and in the white matter tracts that connect them. Furthermore, these studies suggest that brain alterations may be particularly prominent, already at illness onset, in those individuals more likely to have poorer outcomes (eg, higher number of hospital admissions, and poorer symptom remission, level of functioning, and response to the first treatment with antipsychotic drugs). The fact that, even when present, these brain alterations are subtle and distributed in nature, has limited, until now, the utility of MRI in the clinical management of these disorders. More recently, MRI approaches, such as machine learning, have suggested that these neuroanatomical biomarkers can be used for direct clinical benefits. For example, using support vector machine, MRI data obtained at illness onset have been used to predict, with significant accuracy, whether a specific individual is likely to experience a remission of symptoms later on in the course of the illness. Taken together, this evidence suggests that validated, strong neuroanatomical markers could be used not only to inform tailored intervention strategies in a single individual, but also to allow patient stratification in clinical trials for new treatments.\n",

Además, dichos estudios sugieren que las alteraciones cerebrales pueden ser muy importantes, ya al inicio de la enfermedad, en aquellos individuos con más probabilidades de tener peor pronóstico (por ejemplo, mayor número de hospitalizaciones, peor remisión sintomática, menor nivel de funcionamiento y peor respuesta al primer tratamiento con antipsicóticos). De hecho, cuando estas alteraciones cerebrales están presentes, ellas son leves y se distribuyen en cualquier parte, por lo que hasta la fecha la utilidad de la IRM es limitada en el manejo clínico de estos trastornos. Recientemente los planteamientos de la IRM, a partir de las técnicas aprendízaje máquina, han sugerido que estos biomarcadores neuroanatómicos pueden ser empleados con beneficíos clínicos directos. Por ejemplo, empleando las técnicas de máquinas soporte de vectores para regresión, los datos obtenidos con IRM al comienzo de la enfermedad han sido útiles para predetir, con precisión significativa, si un sujeto determinado puede experimentar más adelante una remisión sintomática durante el curso de la enfermedad. En su conjunto esta evidencia sugiere que los marcadores bien establecidos y validados podrían emplearse no solo para informar sobre estrategias de intervención a la medida en un paciente individual, sino también para asignar la estratificación de pacientes en ensayos clínicos de nuevos tratamientos.\n",

Au début de la maladie, ces modifications seraient prédominates chez les sujets plus susceptibles d'évoluer défavorablement (par exemple, un plus grand nombre d'hospitalisations, une moins bonne rémission des symptômes, un niveau de fonctionnement et une réponse moins bons au premier traitement par antipsychotiques). Le fait que ces modifications cérébrales, même lorsqu'elles sont présentes, sont discrètes et de nature diffuse a limité jusqu'à présent l'utilité de l'IRM dans la prise en charge clinique de ces maladies. Plus récemment, des techniques d'IRM comme celles fondées sur un auto-apprentissage par la machine, ont suggéré que ces biomarqueurs neuro-anatomiques peuvent être utilisés en vue de bénéfices cliniques. Par exemple, à l'aide d'une machine à vecteurs de support, les données IRM obtenues au début de la maladie ont permis de prédire, avec une précision significative, chez un patient donné, la probabilité d'une rémission plus ou moins tardive des symptômes au cours de l'évolution de la maladie.

Emerging work suggests that resting state pretreatment metabolic activity in the fronto-insular cortex may distinguish between patients likely to respond to psychotherapy or medication and may function as a treatment-selection biomarker. In contrast, high metabolic activity in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex may be predictive of poor outcomes to both medication and psychotherapy, suggesting that nonstandard treatments may be pursued earlier in the treatment course. Although these findings will require replication before clinical adoption, they provide preliminary support for the concept that brain states can be measured and applied to the selection of a specific treatment most likely to be beneficial for an individual patient.\n",

            "The mechanism of action of antipsychotic drugs is mainly associated with changes in dopaminergic system. The application of antipsychotic agents simultaneously produces changes in concentrations of metabolites (e.g. kynurenic acid - KYNA, 3-hydroxykynurenine - 3-OHKYN, kynurenine - KYN) of the kynurenine pathway, the pathway engaged in glutamatergic transmission. The increase in KYNA levels in certain areas of the central nervous system results in inhibition of glutamatergic transmission. Pharmacologically induced elevation of KYNA levels produces effects similar to those observed after administering ketamine or phencyclidine (the noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist), concerning increased activity of mesolimbic dopamine neurons, as well as reduction in dopamine release from the prefrontal cortex. Recent research results confirm the predictive value of changes in concentrations of kynurenine pathway metabolites for assessment of effectiveness of antipsychotic treatment. Significant relationships were found 1) in schizophrenia between the reduction of psychopathological symptoms and variations in 3-OHKYN levels as well as changes in KYNA/3-OHKYN and KYN/KYNA ratios, 2) in mania between varying tryptophan concentrations and the reduction in manic symptoms achieved with antipsychotic treatment. The research as well presented the possibilities of kynurenine pathway modifications, raising high hopes for their future application as target points for the action of novel antipsychotic agents.\n",

            "In this article, a concept of staging of unipolar affective illness (recurrent depression) is presented. In respective subchapters, three most important aspects of this issue have been discussed: 1) staging of unipolar affective illness; 2) staging of treatment-resistant depression; and 3) conversion of unipolar into bipolar affective illness. The evidence for so called neuroprogression of the illness, accumulated in recent years, has allowed for a classification of staging based on a concept of allostasis and allostatic load. In the course of illness, changes in neuroendocrine system (mainly hypothalamic pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis), immunological system, mechanisms of oxidative stress, neurotransmitters, neurotrophic factors as well as structural and functional changes of the brain occur. In their paper of 2007, Fava and Tossani elaborated a concept of staging of unipolar affective illness presenting a continuum model of five consecutive stages with specific clinical features. In the present paper, a concept of treatment-resistant depression and staging of treatment resistance is presented in the context of several models. An important determinant of treatment-resistant depression is so called subthreshold bipolarity which is connected with worse efficacy of antidepressant drugs. In the course of illness, there is a possibility of changing diagnosis from recurrent depression into bipolar affective illness. The studies on this issue show that frequency of such diagnostic conversion is 1,5% of depressed patients per year.\n",

            "Cognitive deficits constitute an integral part of clinical picture of depression, but often not enough attention has been paid to these deficits, mainly because of the presumption that they are secondary to typical depressive symptoms. It is considered that cognitive impairment is one of the main causes of depressive patients' poor functioning. Cognitive deficits are observed already in the first depressive episode. They may correlate with the severity of depression, with the patient's age and level of education. They may persist regardless of the improvement of depression during treatment. Cognitive deficits in depression are divided into \"cold\" which are not related to emotions, and \"hot\" - related to emotions. The \"cold\" deficits are supposed not to respond to antidepressants and seem to persist even in clinical remission. Vortioxetine is a novel antidepressant with a unique mechanism of action: it acts through the serotonine reuptake inhibition, but works also as 5HT(1A) agonist, as well as partial agonist of the 5HT(1B) receptor and antagonist of the 5HT(1D), 5HT(3) and 5HT(7) receptors. In preclinical studies vortioxetine showed the normalization of serotoninergic, noradrenergic, and dopaminergic transmission, additionally through GABA-ergic and glutaminergic effects. It has antidepressive property, it proved to be efficacious in various types of depression (severe, depression with anxiety, and depression in elderly); it also proved to be efficacious in those patients who did not respond sufficiently to SSRIs and SNRIs treatment. Vortioxetine is also beneficial for cognitive functions in depressed patients.\n",

Although standardized, formulated psychotherapies, i. e., CBT and IPT, have a limited efficacy against antidepressant-resistant or chronic depression, psychotherapy and medication treatment may complement each other in combination. However, the first step in the psychotherapeutic consideration of refractory depression is to give up seeking \"a specific medicine\" which does not exist. On the other hand, a doctor should give his/her patient new hope for recovery and stimulate their motivation for treatment. In the dialogue between a doctor and patient, the following points are to be focused on : 1) The essential part of treatment is not medicine but the patient him-/herself. 2) Recommendation of medication should not further reduce the patient's pride. 3) It should be clear that medication treatment is a collaborative activity between patients and doctors. It is preferable for topics of an interview to extend from a reconsideration of the prescription contents to reconstruction of the daily life. It may be helpful for patients to obtain detailed advice on basic lifestyle aspects, such as sleep, meals, and daily activities.\n",

            "The blockade of metabotropic glutamate 5 (mGlu5) receptor has been reported to exert antidepressant effects in several animal models. We previously reported that both ketamine and an mGlu5 receptor antagonist exerted an effect in a novelty-suppressed feeding (NSF) test, and that the effect of ketamine may be mediated through an α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor-dependent increase in serotonergic transmission. However, the involvement of the serotonergic system in the effect of mGlu5 receptor antagonists in the NSF test is not well understood. Therefore, we examined the roles of the serotonergic system in the effect of an mGlu5 receptor antagonist, 6-methyl-2-(phenylethynyl)pyridine hydrochloride (MPEP), in the NSF test in mice. The administration of MPEP significantly shortened the latency to feed, which was not attenuated by the AMPA receptor antagonist, 2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide (NBQX). The effect of MPEP was abolished by the tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor, para-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA). Moreover, the effect of MPEP was blocked by a serotonin (5-HT)2A/2C receptor antagonist, ritanserin, but not by a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, N-{2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl}-N-(2-pyridynyl) cyclohexane-carboxamide (WAY100635). These results suggest that the effect of an mGlu5 receptor antagonist may be mediated by the serotonergic system, including the stimulation of the 5-HT2A/2C receptor, in an AMPA receptor-independent manner in the NSF test.\n",

            "Sigma-1 receptor ligands have been long expected to serve as drugs for treatment of human diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders, depression, idiopathic pain, drug abuse, and cancer. Recent research exploring the molecular function of the sigma-1 receptor started unveiling underlying mechanisms of the therapeutic activity of those ligands. Via the molecular chaperone activity, the sigma-1 receptor regulates protein folding/degradation, ER/oxidative stress, and cell survival. The chaperone activity is activated or inhibited by synthetic sigma-1 receptor ligands in an agonist-antagonist manner. Sigma-1 receptors are localized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes that are physically associated with the mitochondria (MAM: mitochondria-associated ER membrane). In specific types of neurons (e.g., those at the spinal cord), sigma-1 receptors are also clustered at ER membranes that juxtapose postsynaptic plasma membranes. Recent studies indicate that sigma-1 receptors, partly in sake of its unique subcellular localization, regulate the mitochondria function that involves bioenergetics and free radical generation. The sigma-1 receptor may thus provide an intracellular drug target that enables controlling ER stress and free radical generation under pathological conditions.\n",

The experiment of agents' administration during the conditions of stress (beginning with initial stage) showed that only complex had a protective effect revealed in prevention of the anxiety with the high level of mice communicativeness maintenance. At the stage when the anxious-depressive state is completely formed, buspirone and its complex with GA decreased mice motor activity however complex--less significantly. Here we discuss a possible mechanism of action of investigated agents on the background of changes in the sensitivity of 5-HT1A receptors, induced by the formation of the anxious-depressive state of mice with experience of social stress.

To exert its effects, different drugs of abuse will act on receptors and neurotransmitter transporters, modeling neurotransmitter release into the synaptic cleft. Besides acting on presynaptic neurons also function in neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels in postsynaptic neurons, thereby modifying the signaling pathways.

Thromboembolism is often related to a significant r'iisk of disability or death. Despite many years of investigating the interrelationsbetween use of APs and VTE, they have not been specified yet. This paper aims to summarize reports on the VTE risk factors in patients using APs. Based on the analyzed clinical studies, meta-analyses and.data published by European Medicines Agency, it has been determined, that the main risk factors for VTE are duration of treatment and patient-related factors, such as gender, age, body mass, and physical activity. Current data do not allow to identify the prothrombotic potential for individual APs or indicate a higher risk for developing VTE in patients treated ' with newer atypical APs. Due to the complex pathogenesis of VTE it would benecessaryto perform large, comparative studies, allowing to identify precisely differences in prothrombotic potential of individual APs. It is necessary to specify products with the lowest VTE risk, what would be useful in the treatment of high-risk patients. All patients treated with APs should be assessed with the risk ofVTE and, if needed, appropriate prevention methods (including most of all the elimination of modifiable risk factors) should be implemented. Moreover, patients should be educated in scope of VTE prodromal symptoms. All patients with the higher VTE risk should be diagnosed as soon as possible and adequate treatment should be implemented.\n",

It is a highly hazardous condition, imposing significant risks in psychiatric emergency, as expressedby elevated ratios of adverse events and traumatic experiences (both for patients and medical staff). The available anti-agitation drugs have numerous disadvantages. The orally administered medications (even though preferable to:patients) take hours or even-days for the therapeutic effect to emerge .(and also there is a risk of exacerbating agitation in between). Although rapid onset of action (15-45 minutes) is a noteworthy merit of intramuscular drugs, such an invasive strategy is far too often bound to patients' anxiety, resistance, and traumatic experiences. The need for novel drug formulations (ideally, both integrating the benefits of injectable and orally administered tranquillizing medications, 'and free from their disadvantages) can be, therefore, clearly grasped. Development of.inhaled loxapine exemplifies the attempts to overcome the above-delineated obstacles. As suggested by the available research base, inhaled loxapine seems to be an effective anti-agitation drug in treatment of patients with schizoplhenia and BD (with the onset of action similar to the one observed in intramuscular antipsychotics). However, this formulation of loxapine is distinguished by its non-invasive route of administration, as accompanied by markedly, low risk of side effects or adverse events.\n",

Data from prospective, retrospective and case-control studies as well as systematic reviews, meta-analysis and data from Pregnancy Registry were included. Major congenital malformations as well as specific malformations were reported for each drug. Preliminary findings seem to identify lamotrigine as one ofthe safest antiepileptic drugs to be used in pregnancy. Teratogenity risk oftopiramate is still largely unknown and there are not enough studies to draw even preliminary conclusions. Preliminary studies failed to report an increased risk for major congenital malformations among gabapentin or.oxcarbazepine exposed pregnancies. Even if raising less concern when compared to valproate, carbamazepine should be avoided for its documented teratogenity risk. Valproate seems to be the worst considering major congenital malformations, specific malformations as,well as its detrimental effects on neurodevelopment. On the other hand, lithium might be considered a good option when treating pregnant women affected by bipolar disorder. Given the limited research on mood stabilizers in pregnancy, clinicians need to be very careful when treating child bearing age women.

Alstonine is an indole alkaloid that has an antipsychotic experimental profile comparable with that of clozapine and is compatible with the alleged effects in mental patients. Representing a desirable innovation in the pharmacodynamics of antipsychotic medications, the evidence indicates that alstonine does not bind to D2 dopamine receptors (D2R) and differentially regulates dopamine in the cortical and limbic areas. The purpose of this study was to further investigate the effects of alstonine on D2R binding in specific brain regions using quantitative autoradiography (QAR) and its effects on dopamine (DA) uptake in mouse striatal synaptosomes. The effects of alstonine on D2R binding were determined in the nucleus accumbens and caudate-putamen using QAR in mice treated with alstonine doses that have antipsychotic effects. The effects of alstonine [3H]DA uptake were assessed in synaptosomes prepared from striatal tissue obtained from mice treated acutely or for 7 days with alstonine. Alstonine did not change the D2R binding densities in the studied regions. DA uptake was increased after acute (but not after 7 days) treatment with alstonine. Consistent with the alstonine behavioral profile, these results indicate that alstonine indirectly modulates DA receptors, specifically by modulating DA uptake. This unique mechanism for DA transmission modulation contributes to the antipsychotic-like effects of alstonine and is compatible with its behavioral profile in mice and alleged effects in patients. These results may represent an innovation in the antipsychotic development field.\n",

The purpose of this study is to examine whether TrkB ligands show antidepressant effects in an inflammation-induced model of depression.\n",
            "In this study, we examined the effects of TrkB agonist 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) and TrkB antagonist ANA-12 on depression-like behavior and morphological changes in mice previously exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Protein levels of BDNF, phospho-TrkB (p-TrkB), and TrkB in the brain regions were also examined.\n",
            "LPS caused a reduction of BDNF in the CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC), whereas LPS increased BDNF in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Dexamethason suppression tests showed hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in LPS-treated mice. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of 7,8-DHF showed antidepressant effects on LPS-induced depression-like behavior, and i.p. pretreatment with ANA-12 blocked its antidepressant effects. Surprisingly, ANA-12 alone showed antidepressant-like effects on LPS-induced depression-like behavior. Furthermore, bilateral infusion of ANA-12 into the NAc showed antidepressant effects. Moreover, LPS caused a reduction of spine density in the CA3, DG, and PFC, whereas LPS increased spine density in the NAc. Interestingly, 7,8-DHF significantly attenuated LPS-induced reduction of p-TrkB and spine densities in the CA3, DG, and PFC, whereas ANA-12 significantly attenuated LPS-induced increases of p-TrkB and spine density in the NAc.\n",
            "The results suggest that LPS-induced inflammation may cause depression-like behavior by altering BDNF and spine density in the CA3, DG, PFC, and NAc, which may be involved in the antidepressant effects of 7,8-DHF and ANA-12, respectively.\n",

            "Major depressive disorder (MDD) presents neuropsychological alterations which improve after the treatment, but it might be mediated by clinical variables. Our goal is to study whether the speed of remission of MDD bears any relation to the improvement of the patients' cognitive functioning after a successful treatment. We carried out clinical and neuropsychological assessments of 51 patients with MDD. After these procedures they underwent a 24-week treatment with fluoxetine, and were assessed again with the same battery used prior to treatment. They were arranged into three groups according to how rapid their symptoms remitted. The patients with a rapid remission presented improvements in working memory, speed of information processing, and some executive functions, unlike the other groups. Rapid remitters also improved in episodic memory and executive functions more than the other patients.\n",
